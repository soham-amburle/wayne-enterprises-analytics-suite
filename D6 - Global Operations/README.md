## Overview

The **Global Operations Command Centre Dashboard** provides a centralized operational view of Wayne Enterprises' global business operations, departmental performance, regional efficiency, and enterprise-wide operational effectiveness.

Designed using a large-scale synthetic enterprise dataset, this dashboard enables executives, operations managers, regional leaders, and business analysts to monitor operational efficiency, identify bottlenecks, evaluate departmental performance, and optimize resource utilization across the organization.

The dashboard combines operational intelligence and performance analytics into a single decision-making platform, allowing leadership teams to identify inefficiencies, reduce delays, improve operational effectiveness, and drive strategic business performance.

The dashboard focuses on understanding:

* Global operational activity across regions
* Department-level operational efficiency
* Operational cost trends over time
* Enterprise-wide efficiency performance
* Regional operational effectiveness
* Departmental performance comparison
* Operational delay monitoring
* Organizational structure distribution

By combining KPI indicators, operational analytics, regional performance visuals, and interactive filtering capabilities, the dashboard delivers a comprehensive operational intelligence solution for strategic decision-making.

This dashboard answers several strategic questions:

* Which departments operate most efficiently?
* Which regions demonstrate the strongest operational performance?
* How have operational costs changed over time?
* Where are operational inefficiencies occurring?
* How effectively are resources being utilized across departments?
* Which operational divisions contribute the most activity?
* What trends are impacting operational performance?
* Which areas require operational improvement initiatives?

Through KPI cards, analytical visuals, and interactive filtering, the dashboard provides a complete view of Wayne Enterprises' operational ecosystem.

## Business Storyline & Analytical Flow

### 1. Operational KPI Snapshot – KPI Cards

Seven KPI cards provide an executive summary of overall operational performance:

* **Total Operations**
* **Total Operational Cost**
* **Average Efficiency Score**
* **Average Delay Time (Hours)**
* **Number of Regions**
* **Number of Departments**
* **High Efficiency Operations %**

These KPIs allow executives to quickly assess operational scale, efficiency levels, organizational coverage, and overall enterprise performance.

### 2. Global Operations Performance Visuals

Four analytical visuals provide deeper insights into departmental performance, regional efficiency, and operational trends:

1. **OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY BY DEPARTMENT** – Clustered Bar Chart
2. **OPERATIONAL COST TREND** – Line Chart
3. **REGIONAL OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE** – Clustered Column Chart
4. **OPERATIONS DISTRIBUTION BY DIVISION TYPE** – Donut Chart

These visuals help identify:

* Departments with the highest and lowest efficiency levels
* Operational spending patterns over time
* Regional performance differences across the enterprise
* Distribution of operational activities across business divisions
* Organizational areas requiring performance improvement
* Long-term operational trends impacting business outcomes

### 3. Interactive Slicers

Seven slicers allow dynamic exploration of operational performance:

* Year (`Dim_Date[Year]`)
* Quarter (`Dim_Date[Quarter]`)
* Month Name (`Dim_Date[Month_Name]`)
* Region (`Dim_Region[City]`)
* Region Type (`Dim_Region[Region_Type]`)
* Department (`Dim_Department[Department_Name]`)
* Division Type (`Dim_Department[Division_Type]`)

These filters enable users to analyze operational activity and efficiency across multiple organizational dimensions.

## Data Disclaimer

This dashboard is built using a **synthetic enterprise dataset (~100,000 records)** generated for analytical and demonstration purposes. The data simulates enterprise-level operational management, regional performance monitoring, and departmental efficiency measurement scenarios and does **not represent real corporate operational data**.

The dataset follows a **Hybrid Star Schema data model** consisting of multiple fact tables and dimension tables designed to simulate real-world business intelligence environments.

The data was generated to replicate typical operational analytics scenarios such as:

* Operational efficiency monitoring
* Department performance evaluation
* Regional operations analysis
* Operational cost tracking
* Resource utilization assessment
* Enterprise-wide operational optimization
