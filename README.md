# Wayne Enterprises | Enterprise Business Intelligence Suite (Power BI)
**by Soham S. Amburle**

Start Date: 10 April, 2026

## Project Overview

This project simulates an **enterprise-grade Business Intelligence solution** for a diversified conglomerate similar to Wayne Enterprises, built using **Power BI** and a large-scale **synthetic dataset (~100,000 records)**.

The objective is to demonstrate how executive leadership, R&D divisions, defense operations, corporate departments, and strategic intelligence units can leverage data-driven dashboards to monitor **financial performance, operational efficiency, innovation impact, risk exposure, and city-level intelligence insights**.

This solution uniquely combines **real-world corporate analytics** with **cinematic elements from Gotham City**, creating a hybrid BI ecosystem.

The system is designed as a **15-dashboard enterprise analytics suite**, similar to BI platforms used in multinational corporations.
